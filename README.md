# About this Repo

This is **NOT** the Git repo of the official Docker image for Sonarqube.

This is a temporary workaround for Sonarqube 7.2 Release. As per an [open issue](https://github.com/SonarSource/docker-sonarqube/issues/182) -

``` There’s no Docker image (on purpose, we didn’t forget!) for this version.```

So, until we have an official release, [this image](https://hub.docker.com/r/kubus/sonarqube/) can be used.


See the Hub page for the full readme on how to use the Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The full readme is generated over in [docker-library/docs](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [docker-library/docs/sonarqube](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/sonarqube).
